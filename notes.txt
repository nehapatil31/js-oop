-> object literal syntax

-> if object has one or more methods, then its called object has behavior.

-> factory and contructor functions - to create objects

-> CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION
'new' operator will create a empty object and assine 'this' to that empty object. returns that object.
for browser environment, 'this' points to window object.

-> every object has a property called constructor, that refferences the functions which used in constructing the object.

-> In JS, functions are objects.

-> In JS, we have two types - Value types(Primitive) and Reference Types.

Value types- Number, String, Boolean, Symbol, undefined, null 
Reference Types- Object, Function, Array

-> Primitives are copied by their value
   Objects are copied by their reference.
